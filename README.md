This is my repository for Machine Learning programs in Python showing mini-projects demonstrating the use of Machine Learning in statistical data.
Each folder covers different topics and subtopics of Machine Learning in an easy way with corresponding code and sample data to be analyzed.

*Note- I will keep updating repository whenever possible

System Requirements:
  * 64-bit Windows 7/8/10
  * Intel I3/AMD A8 or higher processor for faster code execution
  * Latest Anaconda version with Spyder IDE for visualizing data along with required ML     libraries(matplotlib,scikit,pandas)
